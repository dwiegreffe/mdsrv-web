    <summary>How to upload local data (from my computer) to a running server?</summary>
<p><div markdown="1">
To upload the data you have locally stored on your computer you first have to import the data into the client and prepare a session to your desires. Then you can store this session on a running server by following the steps in the tutorial on <a href="tutorial.html#t-share-session">Sharing a session</a>.

    <summary>Why do I not see a structure or trajectory?</summary>
<p><div markdown="1">
If you do not see a structure after you imported , there may have been an error during the importing process. Check the _Log_ at the bottom to identify possible errors.

If you imported a coordinate file of a trajectory, you must also import a structure you can match the coordinates to. Follow the steps in the tutorial on <a href="tutorial.html#t-assign-traj">Assign a trajectory to a structure</a>.

If your structure was visible before and now it is not, you may need to check the _State Tree_ to see if your structure is still available. If you can find your structure, check the _visibility toggle_ (eye icon) and turn it on if necessary. If your structure is no longer available, you will need to import it again.
</div></p></details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I change the play mode of the trajectory?</summary>
<p><div markdown="1">

Yes you can. After importing and assigning you trajectory, the _Select Animation_ button will appear.

Select the button to open an additional menu for changing the plan mode of the trajectory.

<center><img src='images/animation_mode_2.png'></center>

    <summary>Why is only part of my trajectory moving? Why is there an overlapping?</summary>
<p><div markdown="1">
After you have assigned your trajectory to your structure, you have not cleaned up the visualization. Currently, both the models of your static structure and your moving trajectory are displayed. To clean up your visualization, open the _State Tree_ on the left and turn off the visibility for your static structure to which you assigned the coordinates of your trajectory.

For a more detailed description on how to clean up the visulation, you can check out the tutorial on <a href="tutorial.html#t-assign-traj">Assign a trajectory to a structure</a>.
