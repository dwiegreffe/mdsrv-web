<p><div markdown="1">
You can download the trajectory to your computer and follow the steps on <a href="faq-vis-traj">how to visualize your trajectory</a>.

If the trajectory is too large to vizualize it this way, you can upload it to our MDsrv by follow the steps in the tutorial <a href="tutorial.html#t-upload-traj">Upload a trajectory to the MDsrv</a>.

You can also set up your own MDsrv to stream the trajectory. Check out the <a href="install.html">Installation</a> page.

    <summary>How to upload local data (from my computer) to a running server?</summary>
<p><div markdown="1">
To upload the data you have locally stored on your computer you first have to import the data into the client and prepare a session to your desires. Then you can store this session on a running server by following the steps in the tutorial on <a href="tutorial.html#t-share-session">Sharing a session</a>.

If you want to upload a trajectory to the MDsrv, because it is too large to vizualize without the client crashing, you can upload the trajectory to the MDsrv by following the steps in the tutorial <a href="tutorial.html#t-upload-traj">Upload a trajectory to the MDsrv</a>.
