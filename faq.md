## How can I assign a trajectory to a structure?

You can find a detailes description on how to assign a trajectory to a structure, including a video, in the tutorial section under [Assign a trajectory to a structure](tutorial.html).

## How can I visualize my trajectory?

To visualize your trajectory follow the steps in the tutorials:
- [Importing structures and trajectories](tutorial.html)
- [Assign a trajectory to a structure](tutorial.html)
- [Play trajectory](tutorial.html)

## How do I play my trajectory?

You can find a detailed description on how to play a trajectory, inluding a video, in the tutorial section under [Play trajectory](tutorial.html).

## How can I share the session I have prepared?

You can share your session in two ways. A detailed description on how to share a session, inluding a video, can be found in the tutorial section under [Sharing a session](tutorial.html).

## How can I share my trajectory?

You can share your trajectory by sharing your session. Check out the FAQ: [How can I share the session I have prepared?](#faq-share-session)

## How can I upload my trajectory to MDsrv?

You can upload a trajectory to the MDsrv for streaming. Note that the trajectory must be publicly available on a server. Follow the steps in the tutorial [Upload a trajectory to the MDsrv](#tutorial.html)

## My trajectory is too large to be displayed and the viewer crashed.
	
To visualize and share large trajectories, you either need to set up your own server or upload the trajectory to our MDsrv.

To set up your own MDsrv, check out the [Install](#install.html) page.

To upload the trajectory to our server, check out the tutorial [Upload a trajectory to the MDsrv](#tutorial.html)

## How do I stream a trajectory from the MDsrv?

You can find a detailed description on how to stream a trajectory from the MDsrv, inluding a video, in the tutorial section under [Stream a trajectory from the MDsrv](#tutorial.html).

## Do I need a public IP to share data with the world?
	
To make your server globally visible you need a public IP. Otherwise it is only visible to devices within your local network.

## I developed a really nice representation and perspective on my trajectory. How do I save this and make it available for others?
	
Check out the FAQ: [How can I share the session I have prepared?](#sfaq-share-session)

## How to align two or more structures based on an already calculated alignment?

You can find a detailed description on how to align two or more structures based on an already calculated alignment, inluding a video, in the tutorial section under [Superpose structures based on a sequence alignment](#tutorial.html).

## How can I import an alignment?

Import the Clustal file (.aln) using the Open Local Files menu in the Home panel on the left-hand side. 

To match the alignemnt to structures, check out the tutorial on [Superpose structures based on a sequence alignment](#tutorial.html)

## How can I add a measurement to my trajectory?

You can find a detailed description on how to add a measurement to a trajectory, inluding a video, in the tutorial section under [Add a measurement to a trajectory](#tutorial.html).

## How can I visualize trajectories that are stored on another server that is not an MDsrv?

You can download the trajectory to your computer and follow the steps on [how to visualize your trajectory](#faq-vis-traj).

If the trajectory is too large to vizualize it this way, you can upload it to our MDsrv by follow the steps in the tutorial [Upload a trajectory to the MDsrv](#t-upload-traj).

You can also set up your own MDsrv to stream the trajectory. Check out the [Installation](#install.html) page.

## Can I upload both my own and public data?

Yes, you can upload your own and public data. Check out the tutorial on [Importing structures and trajectories](#tutorial.html).

## How to upload local data (from my computer) to a running server?

To upload the data you have locally stored on your computer you first have to import the data into the client and prepare a session to your desires. Then you can store this session on a running server by following the steps in the tutorial on [Sharing a session](#tutorial.html)

If you want to upload a trajectory to the MDsrv, because it is too large to vizualize without the client crashing, you can upload the trajectory to the MDsrv by following the steps in the tutorial [Upload a trajectory to the MDsrv](#tutorial.html)

## How to import data from other public servers (such as the Protein Data Bank)?

It is possible to directly import data from public data bases like the PDB. Just follow the tutorial on [Importing structures and trajectories](#tutorial.html).

## Do I have to install MDsrv myself to visualize and share my trajectories?
	
No, you can use our server to visualize and share your trajectories. You can find different Tutorials on how to import and share structures and trajectories on the [Tutorial](#tutorial.html) page.

## How can I select a chain or atoms to be shown or highlighted?

## How can I change the coloring and representation of my molecules?

## How long are remote sessions available that I upload to the server?

## I only want a specific part of my structure to be visible, how do I achieve this?

## I added a measurement to my trajectory, but it is not updating when I change the frame?

## I added a measurement to my trajectory, but there is no time-trace plot available?

## I selected an amino acid in the seuquence view at the top to zoom into my trajectory, but I get an overlay of another structure. Why is this happening?

## Can I download my viszualization as an image or video?

## How do I add a measurement?

## I want to select a chain or atom and not focus on it. How?

## How can I open and close the panels?

## Why do I not see a structure or trajectory?

## Can I change the play mode of the trajectory?

## Why is only part of my trajectory moving? Why is there an overlapping?

## How do I get the URL to my saved session?

## How can I add a sequence alignment
