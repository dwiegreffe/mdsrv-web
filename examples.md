# Examples

### Streaming trajectories from our MDsrv:

In the following examples, the trajectories are stored on our server. During the streaming of a trajectory, only a single frame is fetched to display it. This makes it possible to visualize trajectories that would otherwise be much too large for the available memory of the browser (as in example 3). If a trajectory is streamed from the server, it is still possible to calculate time-trace plots for the measurements.

### Time-trace and RMSD plot 

To view the line plot of the example, you need to open the _Extension_ panel at the bottom and then go to the _Time Trace Graph_ menu. In the lower left corner of the white canvas you can see the progress of the measurement calculation. When the calculation is complete, the measurement is available in the _Time Trace Plot_ menu. You can switch to the RMSD plot for the entire structure by selecting the _RMSD_ button in the _Time Trace Plot_ menu while the desired measurement is selected.

### Alignment View

To view the sequence alignment of the example, you need to open the _Extension_ panel at the bottom and then open the _View Sequence Alignment_ menu. You can hover over the residues to highlight them in the canvas. You can focus on a single residue by clicking on it.
