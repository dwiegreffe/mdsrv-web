#### Examples:



In the following examples, the trajectories are stored on our server. During the streaming of a trajectory, only a single frame is fetched to display it. This makes it possible to visualize trajectories that would otherwise be much too large for the available memory of the browser (as in example 5). If a trajectory is streamed from the server, it is still possible to calculate line plots for the measurements.

To view the line chart of the example, you need to open the Extensions panel at the bottom and then open the Measurement Line Plot menu in the Extensions panel. In the lower-left corner of the white canvas you can see the progress of the measurement calculation. After the calculation is complete, the measurement is available in the Measurement Line Plot menu.
